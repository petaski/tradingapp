# Deriv Bot

## Overview

Deriv Bot is a web-based automated trading platform that allows users to create trading bots without coding. The application uses a visual block-based programming interface (powered by Blockly) to let users design trading strategies. Users can build bots from scratch, use quick strategies, or import existing bot configurations. The platform supports both demo and real trading accounts through the Deriv trading API.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
